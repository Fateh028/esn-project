        <h6>Erasmus Student Network</h6>
        <p>
          Erasmus Student Network The Erasmus Student Network (ESN) of which we,
          ESN Azerbaijan, are a member, is one of the largest student
          associations in Europe, being present in more than 1000 Higher
          Education Institutions from 46 countries and functions as an umbrella
          organisation for many local and national organisations across the
          continent. The organization's primary goal is to foster a more
          adaptable and mobile educational setting by bolstering student
          exchanges at various tiers, offering intercultural experiences even to
          those unable to pursue periods abroad. The Headquarters are based in
          Brussels. Led by the International Board, ESN International has a high
          impact on mobility programmes in the European Higher Education area,
          most notably the Erasmus+ programme. ESN collaborates with important
          stakeholders and policymakers in this area, such as the European
          Commission, the European University Foundation (EUF) and the European
          Studentâ€™s Union (ESU). ESN works for the creation of a more mobile and
          flexible education environment by supporting and developing the
          student exchange from different levels and providing an intercultural
          experience also to those students who cannot access a period abroad
          ("internationalisation at home").
