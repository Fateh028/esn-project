        <h3>Study in Azerbaijan</h3>

      <div className="content-students">
        <p>
          Studying in Azerbaijan is an extraordinary experience. It is unique
          from the personal as well as academic point of view. Being for a few
          months in an international environment is the best opportunity to
          establish intercultural contacts, have a valuable insight into a
          different culture, learn a language and grow as a person. Azerbaijan,
          officially the Republic of Azerbaijan, is located in Transcaucasia,
          also known as the South Caucasus region. It is bounded by the Caspian
          Sea to the east, Russia to the north, Georgia to the northwest,
          Armenia to the west and Iran to the south.

          Places to visit
          <br />
          Baku, the capital city of Azerbaijan, with 2.2 million citizens, lies
          along the Caspian Sea, and is a somewhat curious mix of the old walled
          city of Icheri Seher, and a modern building craze that has led a boom
          in skyscrapers. Baku has a rich historical and cultural value which
          has been preserved for many years. Being very famous for its stunning
          places to visit, Baku welcomes an abundance of tourists each year.
          There are a number of interesting historical sites in Baku you may
          want to visit during your study in Azerbaijan.
          <br />
          Among the historical monuments of Baku, the most exciting one is the
          Old City - Icheri Sheher, surrounded by large fortress walls on three
          sides. It hosts the palace of the Palace of Shirvanshah built in 15th
          century and described by UNESCO as one of the pearls of Azerbaijani
          architecture which includes a complex of various structures: a mosque,
          mausoleum, hamam, divankhana, gates and reservoir.
          <br />
          Another most magnificent and mysterious landmark in Baku is the Maiden
          Tower, or Gyz Galasi built in 12th century which is located in the
          heart of Old City. When you are standing on the top of the tower, you
          can actually see a great city view.
          <br />
          Additionally, City Boulevard (Seaside National Park) offers you a
          marvelous night view that you can enjoy a walk with the company of
          your friends. If you like something extraordinary Mud Volcanoes would
          be a perfect choice for you which is just an hour away from Baku. Last
          but not least, Baku does not forget fans of modern art by suggesting
          to them the Heydar Aliyev Center designed by Zaha Hadid.
