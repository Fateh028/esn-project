          As ESN Azerbaijanâ€™s one of core activities is to support Azerbaijani
          universities in strengthening their internationalization activities,
          the organization carried out the above-mentioned project with the
          support of Erasmus+ Students and Alumni Alliance (ESAA) to assist
          Azerbaijani universities' IROs to better prime international
          activities. The project was aimed to enhance the capacity of
          international relations offices at universities in Azerbaijan to be
          more engaged in effective internationalization activities within
          Erasmus+ program and beyond, such as Erasmus + international student
          and staff mobility, Jean Monnet Actions, Capacity Building in Higher
          Education (CBHE) projects, international joint programs, joint
          research and teaching, and international partnerships via providing
          targeted capacity-building training to international relations office
          staff at the universities across the country.
        </p>
        <p>
          The training project brought together a select group of participants
          and featured notable experts such as Dr. Irina Sikorskaya, Tea
          Gergedeva, and Gulden Bulut. During the event, 35 international
          relations officers gathered from various universities across
          Azerbaijan to participate in the project.
        </p>
        <p>
          Capacity-building training within the TRUST project has been conducted
          through seminars, workshops, and coaching sessions, and monitoring and
          evaluation were made to gauge the efficacy of the training at the end.
          Thus, on the first day of the training, Ms. Tea Gergedava, Head of the
          International Relations Department at Tbilisi State University,
          delivered training on writing and implementing Capacity Building in
          Higher Education projects. On day 2, Ms. Gulden Bulut, an
          International Education Professional at Marmara University, provided
          training on how to develop International Mobility, Partnerships, and
          Erasmus+ International Credit Mobility activities effectively. On the
          final day, Ms. Iryna Sikorska, Director at Mariupol State University's
          Center for International Education, delivered a lecture on effective
          management of International Relations Offices and project proposal
          writing, implementing, and reporting within Jean Monnet Actions.
        </p>
        <p>
          The training project was followed by a networking dinner where those
          who successfully completed the training project were awarded a
          certificate of completion.
